# Conditional Ising Response Model

This repository contains the R code to run all examples mentioned in the paper: Kruis, et al. (submitted) - The physics of (ir)rational choice.

A pre-print of the paper is available at: 

## Run examples
To run the examples:
1. download both the functions.R and examples.R files
2. open the examples.R files
3. set the working directory to the location of the functions.R file
4. execute the code


## Run own choice graph
Aternatively the expected choice frequencies and iterations can be calculated for any given choice graph, provided that the number of vertices is not to large (n > 15). In the examples.R file can be seen how the adjacency matrix (omega) can be setup, as well as the external magnetic field (mu).
